Wireframing is something Hackbright glosses over, but I think it's a valuable method in planning a website. To be honest I never did it prior, but now having done it I would probably wireframe more. Wireframing is just a way to show a visual mockup of what you'd like your site to look like without filling in any content. Below are some mockups I did prior to any coding of this site in [Balsamiq][balsamiq]. Admittedly I put in more text content than I should have in these wireframes, but looking back on it now it's fun to be able to trace back to the very beginnings of this website.
