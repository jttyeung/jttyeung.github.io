Hello, I’m Joanne. I grew up in the quaint little suburbia of Orange, CA - right next to Disneyland. Yeah, believe it or not… I wasn’t really a fan of the amusement park (but strangely enough I am now!). When I was a kid I was clearly a tomboy. My favorite toys were Legos and video games, I hated wearing dresses, and I thought Barbie dolls were scary (FaceSwap Barbie with Chuckie). As the first child in my family, parents were pretty strict on me and had a pretty strong hold on what I could and couldn’t do. One day, in my sophomore year in high school, I was not allowed to play video games anymore. You can guess my reaction. [Insert pouty/angry face here.] But that actually opened up a new path for me; I started making websites with homestead and geocities (remember those??!). I wasn’t too happy with the ads or using the arrow key to count how many pixels I was moving my text and images on my page to get things to line up well, so I started researching how I could build better looking websites and have more control of the features. Believe it or not, there was a time when I pulled up Notepad (not even Notepad++) and typed up everything in order to create a website. As tedious as that sounds, I was blown away by how cool it was. That was 2002. I learned how to build and launch my websites via FTP, and every day was a new adventure in learning. But then college came looming around the corner. What was I going to do with my life? I thought to myself, "making websites was fun and all, but there’s no way I could turn that into a career..."

[SERIOUSLY?!...]

So yadda yadda yadda... I forgot about that nonsense and went off to studying biology, hoping I would one day be saving lives as a doctor. Yay! It took me three years into college and several internships and lab positions later to realize that wasn’t what I wanted to do anymore. I am still working in healthcare now because it's the industry I've known best all my life and I've slowly, but surely, come around to realizing one thing: I love technology, specifically everything that has to do with computers and software. I’m a business analyst/project manager/software implementation specialist - call it what you will - and my favorite part of my job is software troubleshooting. Most people throw their hands up at a software problem or run around screaming "fire!" while my initial instinct is more like: "Hmmm. Why is that happening? How do these systems work together and which part of the connection is breaking? What was the logic that a developer used to put this feature together?" And when I can’t find the solution I might be wanting to bang my head against the wall, but at the same time my mind feels nicely stimulated and I'm thinking, "this is really interesting." I’ll then pass it on to a developer with my research and thoughts and wait to get feedback. Sometimes I'll find pretty interesting problems that turn into enhancements and I think: "Awesome! I understand how things are working enough to make a difference."

[So now what?]

I have great work-life balance and flexible work from home options, my job is pretty easy, and I could choose to coast on this path forever. But you know what? I don't think that’s enough. I’m 30 young and I’m not even a third of the way through my career. As much as coasting is great, I don’t feel like I’m at my best. I’m bored. I am tired of configuring software and trying to solve problems with limited tools. I want more POWER! At some point I discovered that JavaScript was an optional tool we could use to support our product so I started to study JS in my free time after work. I began to realize I really wanted to know more of what development does and I wanted to be like them because I thought their challenges were fun, and they were the ones at the heart of creating solutions or solving problems for all users external and internal.

There was a moment I won’t forget and I’m sure won’t be the last. A developer I was working with asked me, "What’s your background? Do you even KNOW any JavaScript?" "No..." I replied, sheepishly. It was a challenging moment to feel like an imposter and to be discredited so suddenly like that. While I was slightly hurt in that moment, it also changed me - it motivated me to study even more and soon I was the go-to JavaScript expert on the implementation team. I was no developer, but people looked to me as the last stop before reaching out to bug our development team. And I think that’s awesome - I think about what all I could do as an actual developer and the impact I could have! I think about what I could be building as solutions for my team, taking on the creative side of software rather than the reactive. All of that possibility really excites me and is what brings me here to where I am now.

I’m Joanne and I’m here to #hacktheratio.
