        In 2014, my then manager and co-workers convinced me to start listening to podcasts. It was an incredibly difficult sell since I've never considered myself a good auditory learner (or listener), but I decided to give it a shot anyway because everyone around me wouldn't shut up about it. (They, and soon the whole nation it seemed, were all obsessed about <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a>.)
        <br><br>
        A few hours in, I was hooked for life.
        <br><br>
        Since then I've come to love another podcast: <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a>. I love the story-telling and scientific/tech world relevance so much that I went back to the earliest podcast I could find on my app (a 2011 airing at the time), and started listening forward to the present day. (I'm at 2015 episodes now.) Here are some of my favorite episodes I'd like to share with you, in no particular order:
